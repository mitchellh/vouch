# Contributing

This project dogfoods itself and uses a vouch system to manage contributions.
You must be **vouched** to open a pull request. **PRs from unvouched users are
automatically closed.** See below for information on how to get vouched.

For bugs and feature requests, feel free to open issues directly.
**If you use AI,** then refrain from posting solutions unless you understand
them. Otherwise, just post the problems you're experiencing and let
maintainers figure it out.

## Get Vouched

1. Open an issue describing what you want to change and why.
2. Keep it concise
3. Write in your own voice, don't have an AI write this
4. A maintainer will approve it and vouch for you if accepted
5. Once approved, you can submit PRs

If you aren't vouched, any pull requests you open will be
automatically closed. This system exists because open source works
on a system of trust, and AI has unfortunately made it so we can no
longer trust-by-default because it makes it too trivial to generate
plausible-looking but actually low-quality contributions.

## Denouncement

If you engage in repeatedly bad behavior (not reading instructions, being
rude or inflammatory, etc.), you will be _denounced_. This adds you to
a block list from interacting with this project or any other project that
mirrors this project's block list.
