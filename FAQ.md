# FAQ

These are some frequently raised topics about this project.

## How do First-Time Contributors Get Vouched?

There's no reason for getting vouched to be difficult. The primary
thing Vouch prevents is low-effort drive-by contributions. For
my projects (even this one), you can get vouched by simply introducing
yourself in an issue and describing how you'd like to contribute.

**Basically: introduce yourself like any normal human social environment,
and you're vouched.** If you abuse your privilege in the group, then
you'll be denounced.

Ultimately, Vouch does not impose any policy. Policy is up to
downstream projects that integrate Vouch.

## Social Engineering Will Destroy This

Vouched users merely gain the power to even interact with the
project. They don't gain the permission to merge pull requests,
push code, make releases, etc. All of those will be gated by
existing review and system controls.

So at worse, a person can socially engineer their way into being
able to open a pull request _at all_, and then existing reviewers
would take over to review and merge the PR. The same attack vector
of sketchy contributions exists before and after Vouch.

## One Bad Actor Will Ruin This

By default, only admins and collaborators with write access to
the project can vouch or denounce users. A vouched user cannot vouch
other users. So, no, they really won't.
